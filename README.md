Test Task Application:

Contains only One Screen Which has a lottie GIF and animatedText "Hello There".
The application was so simple and I could do it with simple coding way and less coding lines without even Using MVVM Pattern
but I coded the application with MVVM Pattern as a featue that might add some bouns points for me.
I know it could be not perfect but I tried my best and always trying my best to learn and write better and cleaner code. 

Used Solid Lints and run those lines and got zero issues,

  dart analyze;
  
  dart run dart_code_metrics:metrics analyze lib test;
  
  dart run dart_code_metrics:metrics check-unused-files lib test;
  
  dart run dart_code_metrics:metrics check-unused-l10n lib test;
